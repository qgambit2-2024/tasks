- As a regular user, I should only see the first names of all players. 

Scope:

- Plan and implement a new feature in your service
- Add test coverage

- Create a new API to wrap this functionality
- Create the output either in text/valid JSON as part of this API
- Add 1 unit test : variate the prompt to test few scenarios
- Dataset assumptions (Pick one of these options) 
       1. Pickup data from Player.csv 
       2. Pickup examples from google
